# Mev Practice in ETH and AVAX

I want to keep track on what I am doing in MEV space, which is a good learning path for me. I have sharpened my skills in EVM and protocol inner workings. 

Currently I implemented pending transaction pool watcher for ETH and explored snowsight relay in AVAX. 

Work in progress.
